HOW THEY'RE GRADED

Contaminated or potentially contaminated sites fit into five categories:

Contamination confirmed – applies to a site where there is evidence of hazardous substances and the site is likely to have adverse effects on humans or the environment until it is remedied or managed.

Contamination acceptable, managed/remediated – sites where there is evidence of hazardous substances but the level of risk of adverse effects on humans or the environment is acceptable for the land use.

Verified history of hazardous activity or industry – sites once used for an activity involving hazardous substances. No certainty that site is contaminated.

Unverified history of hazardous activity or industry – sites where unconfirmed reports indicate an activity involving hazardous substances may have occurred.

No identified contamination – sites have been investigated and confirmed to be clear of contamination
